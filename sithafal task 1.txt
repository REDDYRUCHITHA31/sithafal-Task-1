Here’s a step-by-step guide to implementing a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline in Python for interacting with both PDFs and websites. This explanation is detailed to ensure you understand the entire process.

Step 1: Understand the RAG Pipeline
A RAG pipeline involves:

Data Ingestion: Extract content from sources (PDFs or websites), split it into chunks, and store the data in a searchable vector database.
Query Handling: Convert user queries into embeddings and retrieve the most relevant chunks from the database.
Response Generation: Use a language model (like GPT-4) to generate a response based on the retrieved data.
Step 2: Install the Required Tools
Before starting, install the required Python libraries:


pip install langchain faiss-cpu PyPDF2 beautifulsoup4 requests sentence-transformers openai



Step 3: Code for Chat with PDFs
Here’s how to process PDFs and interact with the content:

1. Data Ingestion
Load the PDF: Use PyPDFLoader to extract text.
Chunk the Text: Split large chunks into smaller ones for efficient search.
Generate Embeddings: Use a pre-trained embedding model to convert text chunks into vectors.
Store Embeddings: Use FAISS as the vector database to store embeddings.



code:


from langchain.document_loaders import PyPDFLoader
from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter
from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain.vectorstores import FAISS

def ingest_pdf(pdf_path):
    # Step 1: Load the PDF
    loader = PyPDFLoader(pdf_path)
    documents = loader.load()

    # Step 2: Chunk the text
    text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=200)
    chunks = text_splitter.split_documents(documents)

    # Step 3: Generate embeddings
    embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()  # Uses OpenAI embeddings by default
    vector_store = FAISS.from_documents(chunks, embeddings)
    
    return vector_store





2. Query Handling
Convert Query into Embedding: Match the query embedding with stored embeddings in FAISS.
Retrieve Relevant Chunks: Perform similarity search.
Pass to Language Model: Use GPT-4 or similar LLM to generate responses.





from langchain.chains import RetrievalQA
from langchain.llms import OpenAI

def query_pdf(vector_store, query):
    # Create retriever and QA chain
    retriever = vector_store.as_retriever()
    qa_chain = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(llm=OpenAI(), retriever=retriever)
    
    # Process the query
    response = qa_chain.run(query)
    return response





3. Usage Example
Combine the ingestion and query handling steps:

python
Copy code


if __name__ == "__main__":
    pdf_path = "example.pdf"  # Replace with the actual PDF file
    query = "What is the unemployment rate for each degree type?"

    # Ingest the PDF and create the vector store
    vector_store = ingest_pdf(pdf_path)
    
    # Query the vector store
    response = query_pdf(vector_store, query)
    print(response)







Step 4: Code for Chat with Websites
1. Data Ingestion
Scrape Website Content: Use BeautifulSoup to extract text.
Chunk and Embed: Split and convert the website’s text into embeddings.
Store Embeddings: Again, use FAISS for efficient retrieval.






from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import requests
from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter
from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain.vectorstores import FAISS

def ingest_website(url):
    # Step 1: Scrape the website
    response = requests.get(url)
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, "html.parser")
    text = soup.get_text(separator="\n")

    # Step 2: Chunk the text
    text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=200)
    chunks = text_splitter.create_documents([text])

    # Step 3: Generate embeddings
    embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()
    vector_store = FAISS.from_documents(chunks, embeddings)

    return vector_store







2. Query Handling
This step is identical to the one used for PDFs. Pass the query to the vector database to retrieve relevant information and use an LLM for response generation.




def query_website(vector_store, query):
    retriever = vector_store.as_retriever()
    qa_chain = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(llm=OpenAI(), retriever=retriever)
    response = qa_chain.run(query)
    return response






3. Usage Example
python
Copy code
if __name__ == "__main__":
    url = "https://www.stanford.edu/"  # Replace with the desired website
    query = "What are the key academic offerings at Stanford?"

    # Ingest website data
    vector_store = ingest_website(url)
    
    # Query the vector store
    response = query_website(vector_store, query)
    print(response)
    
    
    
    
    Step 5: Run the Code
Replace the pdf_path or url in the examples with your target PDF or website.
Define queries based on the information you want to retrieve.
Run the code and observe the output!
Step 6: Explanation of Key Components
LangChain: Manages the pipeline by combining embeddings, vector databases, and LLMs.
FAISS: A fast similarity search library for vector embeddings.
Text Splitters: Ensures data is chunked into manageable pieces for better search granularity.
Embedding Models: Converts text into vector representations.
LLM (GPT-4): Handles the final query and response generation.
Step 7: Possible Enhancements
Use a local embedding model like SentenceTransformers if OpenAI is not available.
Switch the vector database to Pinecone or Weaviate for scalability.
Add comparison query support: Aggregate data from multiple sources and present in tabular format.
